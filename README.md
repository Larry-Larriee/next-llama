# Tailwind Llama

Tailwind Llama is a web app designed to help people learn how to code with Tailwind CSS. It was designed because I found a lack of resources to help learn tailwind, which can be difficult and tedious to pick up. 

Inspired by CSSBattles, Tailwind Llama tasks you to replicate cool designs, which get more difficult as you climb levels. After you've finished your design, Tailwind Llama will review with you the tailwind classes you've used, in addition to your time spent and accuracy. 

Get good at Tailwind. Go to <a href="https://tailwind-llama.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Tailwind Llama</a> today!
